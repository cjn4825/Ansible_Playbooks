# Ansible playbooks

A repository that includes Ansible playbooks and Python scripts used for NetOps and mini project orchestration.

In progress: All the uploaded code is from before I installed the ASA firewalls into the [Homelab](https://github.com/cjn4825/Homelab-Portfolio). I'm currently creating playbooks for various tasks that can be performed with these, such as image and running config backups.
